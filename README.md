# Psuedo-WYSIWYG theme for Obsidian
A theme for [Obsidian](https://obisidian.md/), which attempts to build out a
psuedo-WYSIWYG-like experience (as much as custom CSS will allow).

## Install
1. Download obsidian.css to your Obsidian vault folder.
2. In Obsidian, click Settings->Plugins and turn on "Custom CSS".
3. There is no step 3! Enjoy!

## Build
The actual theme is being written in [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/), so you'll
need to build the `obsidian.scss` (as `obsidian.css`) if you make changes.

## Licence
I don't really care what happens to this theme, so I put it under [The Unlicense](./LICENSE) and set it free!
